*TASK DESCRIPTION*:

The "Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor" project was designed to allow multiple users to edit a document simultaneously from different devices, with changes reflected in real time. The frontend of the application was built using React.js, which provided a dynamic and responsive user interface. For text editing functionality, React-Quill was integrated, allowing users to apply rich text formatting in an intuitive editor. The backend was developed using Node.js with Express.js, and Socket.IO was used to enable real-time, bi-directional communication between the frontend and the server. This ensured that any change made by one user was instantly broadcast to all other connected users editing the same document.

The database layer was handled using MongoDB, which stored the document data persistently. This allowed users to retrieve previously saved versions of a document even after refreshing or closing the application. The entire project was built using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment, and the local development server was run using both npm start for the frontend and node server.js for the backend. Key functionalities included real-time synchronization, automatic saving at regular intervals, and document loading through unique identifiers.

In real-world scenarios, this project has wide applicability, such as in online collaborative platforms like Google Docs, team-based writing tools, educational tools for remote classrooms, and technical documentation platforms. It introduces developers to core concepts like WebSockets, real-time data handling, frontend-backend integration, and state management in React. This project is a perfect example of how multiple technologies can be integrated to solve real-time collaboration problems in today's remote and hybrid working environments.
